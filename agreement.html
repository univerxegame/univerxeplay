<div class="terms-wrapper"><div class="markdown terms-text"><h1>NFT PURCHASE AGREEMENT</h1>
<p>This NFT Purchase Agreement (this ‚Äú<strong>Agreement</strong>‚Äù) is a legally binding agreement by and between Vantage Top Group Limited (‚Äú<strong>Univerxe</strong>‚Äù) and the initial and any subsequent purchaser of this Univerxe Land (defined below) (‚Äú<strong>you</strong>‚Äù or ‚Äú<strong>Purchaser</strong>‚Äù). Univerxe and each Purchaser may be referred to throughout this Agreement collectively as the ‚Äú<strong>Parties</strong>‚Äù or individually as a ‚Äú<strong>Party</strong>‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED BELOW) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND Univerxe THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 10 ‚ÄúDISPUTE RESOLUTION‚Äù BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 10 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 9 ‚ÄúGOVERNING LAW‚Äù OR RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE LAW WILL STILL APPLY. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS AN OBLIGATION ON Univerxe TO CREATE / PROVIDE ANY ACCESS RIGHTS IN RELATION TO THE Univerxe LandS.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>1. Agreement to Terms.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(a) General.</strong> By purchasing an Univerxe Land, you acknowledge that you have carefully read and agree to the terms of this Agreement. ‚Äú<strong>Univerxe Land</strong>‚Äù means a non-fungible token (NFT) (i.e., a controllable electronic record recorded on a blockchain). Each Univerxe Land is digital in nature and is not linked to and is not sold together with (i) any items or representations that have physical dimensions such as mass or volume, or (ii) any Access Rights (as defined below) as of the time of purchase. This Agreement governs your participation in the Primary Transactions on <a href="https://univerxe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" node="[object Object]">https://univerxe.io/</a> (the ‚Äú<strong>Website</strong>‚Äù) as well as Secondary Transactions between Transferors and Transferees (as defined below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(b) Additional Terms.</strong> The access and use of the Website are subject to the separate terms of the Website available at <a href="https://univerxe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" node="[object Object]">https://univerxe.io/</a>: Purchaser further acknowledges that Purchaser has carefully read and has accepted the (i) Website Terms of Service (the ‚Äú<strong>Website Terms</strong>‚Äù) and (ii) the Website Privacy Policy (the ‚Äú<strong>Website Privacy Policy</strong>‚Äù) because the Website Terms and the Website Privacy Policy govern its use of the Website. This Agreement controls if there is a conflict between, on the one hand, any of the Website Terms or the Website Privacy Policy, and, on the other hand, this Agreement,  with respect to  Univerxe Land.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>2. Ownership of Univerxe Land.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> When Purchaser acquires an Univerxe Land, Purchaser owns all personal property rights to that Univerxe Land (<em>e.g.</em>, the right to freely sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of that Univerxe Land).  No other rights of any kind or nature with respect to the Univerxe Land or any image or other intellectual property associated with, related to, or linked to, an Univerxe Land are granted or licensed to Purchaser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Ownership of an Univerxe Land may following the date hereof entitle the Purchaser to certain tangible or rights, benefits, interests, preferences, or privileges herein offered from time to time by Univerxe or third parties in their respective sole discretion (‚Äú<strong>Access Rights</strong>‚Äù). Access Rights, if any, will be offered pursuant to separate terms (whether written or unwritten) published from time to time by Univerxe, or the applicable third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> Purchaser represents and warrants that Purchaser will not transfer an Univerxe Land in any Secondary Transaction to a Transferee who is designated or specified under regulations made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (Chapter 13) of the laws of England and Wales. (‚Äú<strong>Prohibited Transferee</strong>‚Äù). A ‚Äú<strong>Secondary Transaction</strong>‚Äù means any transaction in which an Univerxe Land is sold by one owner to another owner, or is otherwise transferred, distributed, or disseminated (regardless of whether consideration is paid) in any manner that is not a Primary Transaction; and ‚Äú<strong>Primary Transaction</strong>‚Äù means a transaction facilitated through the Website in which an Univerxe Land is first sold to Purchaser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> For the avoidance of doubt, without limiting Section 2(a), nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to grant Purchaser any rights in or to any image or other intellectual property associated with, related to, or linked to, an Univerxe Land, including any right to use such image or intellectual property for any non-personal or commercial purposes, or to create any derivative works of such image or intellectual property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the limited extent that an image is displayed as a result of the operation of the smart contract related to the Univerxe Land in connection with Purchaser‚Äôs use of an Univerxe Land in accordance with this Agreement, Purchaser will have the right to display such image for Purchaser‚Äôs own personal, non-commercial purpose for so long as Purchaser owns the Univerxe Land.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3. Payment and Fees.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(a) Purchase and Sale.</strong> Purchaser hereby agrees to purchase the Univerxe Land at the price set forth on the transaction page of the Website and in accordance with the procedures set forth on the Website (the ‚Äú<strong>Primary Transaction Purchase Price</strong>‚Äù). Without limiting any of the foregoing, the valid acceptance of this Agreement, including the delivery of the Univerxe Land, is conditioned upon the following terms being met: (i) Purchaser‚Äôs payment of the Primary Transaction Purchase Price, (ii) Purchaser‚Äôs provision, through the Website, of a Ethereum Network-compatible network wallet address and a ‚Äúwallet‚Äù that is compatible with the Website (‚Äú<strong>Wallet</strong>‚Äù) to which the Univerxe Land will be delivered; and (iii) Purchaser‚Äôs successful completion (as determined by Univerxe in its sole discretion) of any applicable diligence and other processes as requested by the Univerxe. If the Purchaser fails to meet any of the conditions above, Univerxe may suspend the delivery of the purchased Univerxe Land or terminate the Primary Transaction. Univerxe reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to limit the number of Univerxe Lands that may be purchased by any single person.  Purchaser may only purchase a maximum number of Univerxe Lands per Wallet as determined from time to time by Univerxe in its sole discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(b) Purchaser Presentations.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(i)</strong> <em>Eligibility.</em> Purchaser represents and warrants that (A) Purchaser completed the ‚Äúknow-your-customer‚Äù process made available at <a href="https://magiceden.com/univerxe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" node="[object Object]">https://magiceden.com/univerxe</a> in accordance with the terms applicable thereto (the ‚Äú<strong>KYC Process</strong>‚Äù), (B) the Wallet is owned by the person whose information was provided in the KYC Process, (C) the information provided in connection with the KYC Process is true and accurate as of the date hereof, (D) Purchaser is not purchasing any Univerxe Land on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any other person or entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(ii)</strong> <em>Qualifications.</em> Purchaser represents and warrants that Purchaser (A) is not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a terrorist-supporting country; (B) is not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties; (C) is not designated or specified as a Prohibited Transferee, (D) is the age of majority in Purchaser‚Äôs place of residence (which is typically 18 years of age in most U.S. states) and has the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement; (D) will use and interact with the Univerxe Land only for lawful purposes and in accordance with this Agreement; and (E) will not use the Univerxe Land to violate any law, regulation or ordinance or any right of Univerxe, its licensors or any third party, including without limitation, any right of privacy, publicity, copyright, trademark, or patent. Purchaser further agrees that he/she will comply with all applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(iii)</strong> <em>Artistic Purposes Only.</em> Purchaser represents and warrants that Purchaser (A) is purchasing the Univerxe Land for personal enjoyment purposes, and (B) is not purchasing any Univerxe Land with the intent or expectation of profits from any appreciation in value or otherwise from the Univerxe Land or any Access Rights that may from time to time be granted by Univerxe or third parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(iv)</strong> <em>Qualified Consumer.</em> Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser has sufficient understanding of the functionality, usage, storage, transmission mechanisms and other material characteristics of non-fungible cryptographic tokens, token wallets and other token storage mechanisms, public and private key management, blockchain technology, and blockchain-based software systems to understand this Agreement. Purchaser understands, acknowledges and agrees that such knowledge allows it to appreciate the implications and risks of acquiring the Univerxe Land herein.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(c) Form of Payment.</strong> All payments for the Primary Transaction Purchase Price shall be made via ApeCoin, unless otherwise determined in Univerxe‚Äôs sole discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(d) Gas Fees.</strong> By buying or selling an Univerxe Land on the Website or any other platform, you agree to pay all applicable fees, including, but not limited to, any transaction fees and Gas Fees, as applicable. ‚Äú<strong>Gas Fees</strong>‚Äù fund the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network, meaning that the Purchaser will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Ethereum network. Univerxe does not have any insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor does Univerxe have the ability to reverse any transactions. Accordingly, Univerxe will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions of the Univerxe Lands that you engage in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(e) Transfers:</strong> All Secondary Transactions are subject to Section 3(b) of this Agreement, as well as the following terms: (i) the Univerxe Land transferee (the ‚Äú<strong>Transferee</strong>‚Äù) shall, by purchasing or otherwise receiving the Univerxe Land, be deemed to accept all of the terms of this Agreement as a ‚ÄúPurchaser‚Äù hereof (other than with respect to Sections 3(a) and 3(c)); and (ii) the Univerxe Land transferor (the ‚Äú<strong>Transferor</strong>‚Äù) shall provide notice to the Transferee of this Agreement, including a link or other method by which the terms of this Agreement can be accessible by the Transferee, and shall cause the Transferee to agree to the terms of this Agreement. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that all Secondary Transactions will be effected on the Ethereum blockchain, the blockchain network governing the Univerxe Land, and Purchaser will be required to make or receive payments exclusively through Purchaser‚Äôs cryptocurrency wallet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>4. Warranty Disclaimers.</strong></h2>
<p>ALL Univerxe LandS ARE PROVIDED ‚ÄúAS IS,‚Äù WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

Univerxe ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE DISCLAIMED PARTIES MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE  THAT THE Univerxe Land WILL MEET PURCHASER‚ÄôS REQUIREMENTS, OR THE Univerxe Land WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS. NEITHER Univerxe NOR THE DISCLAIMED PARTIES MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY REGARDING OR GUARANTEE REGARDING THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT RELATED TO THE Univerxe Land.</p>
<p>NEITHER Univerxe NOR THE DISCLAIMED PARTIES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO PURCHASER FOR ANY LOSS, AND TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO PURCHASER FOR, ANY USE OF THE Univerxe Land, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (I) USER ERROR SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS, INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS, OR MISTYPED WALLET ADDRESSES; (II) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (III) CORRUPTED FILES; (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO THE Univerxe Land; OR (V) ANY THIRD PARTY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OF VIRUSES, HACKING, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Assumption of Risk.</strong> Purchaser accepts and acknowledges all risks associated with the following:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> The disclaimers set forth in Section 4 above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Any Access Rights, and the lack of Access Rights, as may be the case from time to time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> Purchaser is solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes and gas fees apply to Purchaser‚Äôs purchase, sale, or transfer of the Univerxe Land. Univerxe is not responsible for determining or paying the taxes or gas fees that apply to such transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> Univerxe Lands are digital assets recorded and transferable on the Ethereum blockchain. Any transfer of an Univerxe Land occurs through automated processes on the Ethereum blockchain,  which is not controlled in any capacity by Univerxe. Transactions involving Univerxe Lands may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions of the Univerxe Lands shall be deemed to be made when recorded on the Ethereum blockchain ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that Purchaser initiated the transaction.</p>
